# Admin diagrams

Admin diagrams are organized by diagram type and file format so that source files, editable diagrams, and rendered previews are easy to locate.

```text
admin/
├── sequence/
│   ├── source/    # Visual Paradigm .vpp source files
│   ├── plantuml/  # PlantUML sequence-diagram sources
│   └── images/    # Rendered sequence-diagram PNG files
└── use-case/
    ├── plantuml/  # PlantUML use-case-diagram sources
    └── images/    # Rendered use-case-diagram PNG files
```

The root-level `SEQUENCE/` directory is intentionally not used. New Admin diagram assets should be added to the appropriate folder under `docs/diagrams/admin/`.
